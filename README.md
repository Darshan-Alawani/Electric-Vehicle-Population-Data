This is a personal Data Analysis project that I pursued and demonstrates the skills that I implemented in the completion of this project. This project deals with the analysis of the Electric Vehicle Population in the United States from 2012 - 2023.
The dataset was obtained from the website - https://data.gov/
Link to the dataset - https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data

The dataset was downloaded as a CSV file and opened in Microsoft Excel. On opening the dataset, we see 17 columns namely - VIN (1-10), County, City, State, Postal Code, Model, Year, Make, Electric Vehicle Type, Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility,	Electric Range,	Base MSRP	Legislative District,	DOL Vehicle ID,	Vehicle Location,	Electric Utility,	2020 Census Tract.

Removed the columns - Base MSRP	Legislative District,	DOL Vehicle ID,	Vehicle Location, 2020 Census Tract and Postal Code as these columns seemed irrelevant to the project. The modified dataset was then uploaded to the MS SQL server for data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

After the data cleaning, did some EDA to observe for some trends and insights to see the Electric Vehicle Population distribution throughout the United States and the general increase in the EV population year by year.

Post the data cleaning and EDA in SQL, imported the final dataset into Tableau to create visualizations for the trends and insights observed during the EDA process in SQL.

After the dataset was successfully imported into Tableau, prepared some charts to showcase the trends observed.
